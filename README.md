# groep-project-periode-3-group-4

In this git repository our code for project 3 is stored, because we mostly tested our code through github it also serves as a history for this project.

The code found in this repository was mostly written by Deniz Lektem√ºr and Pieter Ruijs with Jasper de Zeeuw helping in testing and problem solving.

The repository has the main folder wich contains: 
The sourcefile BrickPi3.cpp with the headerfile BrickPi3.hpp, 
The code wich controls our robot and our readme file. 
Furthermore there is a branch labeled failures wich contains all our previous codes with the history. 

To compille the code you need to have the source file in the same folder as the code. 
When the code is run there will be a prompt asking the user to calibrate the light and colorsensor, 
after wich the code will run without any further user input.
